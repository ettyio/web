Objects emit blackbody radiation with a characteristic wavelength determined by <strong>Wien’s displacement law: <u>λmax = 2,897/T</u></strong> (where wavelength is in microns and temperature is in kelvin).
Photons emitted by room-temperature objects (around 300 K) are in the infrared and are not visible to humans.

<p>Heat capacity is the amount of energy you need to add to an object to 
warm it up by 1 K. The heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g/K; in other words, if 
you add 4.18 J to 1 g of water, the water will warm by 1 K. Imagine you have a 
cup containing 200 g of water that is absorbing 150 W of power. Check your 
answers by making sure the units work out.</p> 
<p>Refrigerators are essentially reverse ovens – they cool things by maintaining 
the walls at low temperatures. Imagine you put a turkey with a temperature of 
80 ℃ into a refrigerator with walls of 3 ℃.</p>
